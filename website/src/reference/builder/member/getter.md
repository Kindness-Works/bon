# `getter` :microscope:

**Applies to:** <Badge type="warning" text="struct fields"/> <Badge type="warning" text="function arguments"/> <Badge type="warning" text="method arguments"/>

Allows getting a reference to an already set member.

::: danger ðŸ”¬ **Experimental**

This attribute is available under the cargo feature `experimental-getter`. Breaking changes may occur between **minor** releases but not between patch releases.

The fate of this feature depends on your feedback in the tracking issue [#149](https://github.com/elastio/bon/issues/221). Please, let us know if you have a use case for this attribute!

:::

This attribute now makes the following possible:

```rust
#[derive(bon::Builder)]
struct Example {
    #[builder(getter)] // [!code highlight]
    x: u32,
}

let builder = Example::builder().x(1);

let x_ref = builder.get_x(); // [!code highlight]

builder.build();
```

## Config

`getter` is configured quite similarly to [`setters`](./setters).

You can specify any combination of a `name`, `vis`, and `doc` for the getter, or you can omit all of them and use it as a flag to inherit default values for your getters.

### Example

```rust
#[derive(bon::Builder)]
struct Example {
    #[builder(getter(name = get_my_member, vis = "pub(crate)", doc { // [!code highlight]
        /// `get_my_member` gets a ref to the member // [!code highlight]
    }))] // [!code highlight]
    member: u32, // [!code highlight]
}

// Name of `some_fn` that accepts the non-None value was overridden
let builder = Example::builder().member(2);

let my_member = builder.get_my_member(); // [!code highlight]
```

## `name`

The default name for getters are chosen according to the following rules:

| Member type | Default        |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| Required    | `get_{member}` |
| Optional    | `get_{member}` |

## `vis`

The visibility must be enclosed with quotes. Use `""` or [`"pub(self)"`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/visibility-and-privacy.html#pubin-path-pubcrate-pubsuper-and-pubself) for private visibility.

The default visibility is the same as the visibility of the [`builder_type`](../top-level/builder_type#vis), which in turn, defaults to the visibility of the underlying `struct` or `fn`.

## `doc`

Simple documentation is generated by default. The syntax of this attribute expects a block with doc comments.

```attr
doc {
    /// Doc comments
}
```
